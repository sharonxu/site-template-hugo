I am a data scientist, an avid reader, an adventurous cook, and an aspiring gym bro. If curiosity killed the cat, it's a good thing I have nine lives.

For me, statistics holds a near incomparable power – the power to understand the world around us, to quantify uncertainty and unlock the truth of how things really are, as opposed to what they seem to be. As a data scientist, I wield this power carefully, for it is just as easy to misrepresent and bend reality to your will as it is to uncover real insight and help inform decisions that make a positive impact on our communities and those in need.

The latter is why I do what I do. There are so many problem spaces today accumulating increasingly more data, so many issues in this world that sorely need interdisciplinary solutions. As a data scientist, I am especially passionate about finding impactful sustainability solutions, and have both [worked](https://www.indigoag.com) and [volunteered](https://www.climatechange.ai) many hours in service to this cause. I especially enjoy bringing people from different backgrounds together, really challenging assumptions and unlocking innovation. As an advocate for this, I place an emphasis on collaboration and communication, as well as mentorship in these areas. These skills are so, so important and needed in this age where, as data scientists, we will need to partner with experts from many fields to solve today's most pressing problems.
